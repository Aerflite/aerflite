If you enjoy flying model aircraft, the Aerflite flight controller can provide
an enhanced model flying experience.

Aerflite is a  simple and fun flight controller in the spirit of the original [ArduPilot](http://www.ardupilot.org) <sup id="a1">[1](#note1)</sup>

## Features


   - ### On Screen Display (OSD)
     You can plug in a video camera mounted on your aircraft and use FPV goggles 
     to get a dramatic birds eye view of the world from your model's perspective.

     The view you see also has a highly customisable on-screen display which can 
     give you real-time flight information such as altitude, compass heading, 
     attitude and direction and distance to home.


   - ### Return To Launch Capability (RTL)

     When your plane is flying, at the flick of a switch on your transmitter,
     your plane will automatically fly back to the spot that you launched it from
     without you even touching the transmitter sticks.
